# Project-T5_Bootcamp_


 this project is for  T5 Bootcamp(online), And I will analyze ‘Online Shoppers Intention ‘data to try improve the customers experience with the website, to gain more revenues 

And answer these few questions:

•	Is the weekend a factor to raise the revenue?

•	the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g., Mother’s Day, Valentine's Day) effect the revenue?

•	What features has the strong correlation with revenue?
